Phase 1: Foundation & Community Building
Develop Core Documents: Finalize and publish the foundational academic paper, executive summary, DSS Charter (Bill of Digital Rights), training outlines, and roadmap.

Launch GitHub Repository: Set up with all documents, version control, issue tracking, and collaboration tools.

Website Development and Launch:

Create a simple, clear, accessible website as the official hub for DSS.

Include mission statement, overview, downloadable resources, links to GitHub, contact info, and community engagement tools.

Use the website to share updates and collect feedback or expressions of interest.

Stakeholder Outreach: Begin networking with cybersecurity professionals, academics, companies, advocacy groups, and policy makers through the website and social channels.

Community Building: Start building an open collaborative community around DSS via forums, mailing lists, or social media linked from the website.

Phase 2: Training & Education Development
Develop Multi-Level Training Programs: Build out detailed curricula for Levels 1, 2, and 3 DSS certification tracks.

Host Training Resources Online: Publish training materials, videos, quizzes, and certifications on the website or linked learning platforms.

Expand Website Functionality:

Add user registration and profile management for DSS certification tracking.

Provide tools for training progress and feedback collection.

Create a “DSS Pledge” feature and a visible badge system for companies or individuals who commit to DSS principles.

Phase 3: Policy Integration & Industry Adoption
Policy Proposals: Use the website to publish policy whitepapers and encourage public commentary.

Corporate Engagement: Facilitate a portal for companies to report DSS compliance, linked to ESG-style rating dashboards.

Promote Public Awareness: Run campaigns, webinars, and workshops announced and supported through the website.

Collaboration with Regulators: Engage government agencies and industry groups through the site’s official channels.

Phase 4: Continuous Improvement & Ecosystem Growth
Feedback and Metrics: Collect user, company, and community feedback via website surveys and analytics.

Ongoing Content Updates: Publish research updates, best practices, success stories, and news.

Technology Integration: Host tools or APIs supporting DSS credentials and verification.

Scaling: Expand website and community features to support global collaboration and cross-sector partnerships.

Summary
Website development is integral from the very start — it not only supports transparency and community-building but serves as the living face of DSS to the world. It evolves with the project, from a simple informational hub to a comprehensive platform for training, certification, compliance reporting, and engagement.
