🔍 DSS Pillar Prioritization: Relevance, Depth & Innovation
Guiding Outreach & Strategic Framing

🔑 Purpose
This guide ranks the six key pillars of Digital Social Security (DSS) based on:

📈 Frequency in cybersecurity conversations

🧠 Depth of public/industry understanding

🚀 Novelty introduced by DSS

It helps identify where DSS has the strongest leverage for outreach, education, and buy-in.

1. Credentialed Users
💬 Most discussed | 🔍 Well understood | 🆕 DSS Enhances

Frequent talk about MFA, passwordless auth, digital ID.

DSS adds civic trust, revocability, and layered access credentials.

Great hook for introducing DSS.

2. Software & Device Credentials
💬 Growing interest | 🔍 Moderate understanding | 🆕 DSS Expands

Sits at the intersection of DevSecOps and supply chain security.

DSS ties compiled software to cryptographic identity (e.g., DSS badge for software).

Strong technical selling point.

3. Defense in Depth & Trust Zones
💬 Occasionally discussed | 🔍 Often shallowly understood | 🆕 DSS Unifies

Known in military/infra sectors, but fragmented in web/app security.

DSS offers a civilian-friendly zoning model (public, credentialed, restricted).

Good for technical and policy stakeholders.

4. Bot & Fake Actor Prevention
💬 Constantly discussed | 🔍 Narrowly explored | 🆕 DSS Adds Citizen-Grade Prevention

Everyone wants bot mitigation — but most rely on CAPTCHA/MFA.

DSS’s cryptographically verifiable identity model adds real deterrence.

Solid cross-cutting use case.

5. Cleanroom/Code Provenance Models
💬 Niche discussion | 🔍 Deep in certain circles | 🆕 DSS Democratizes

Important for zero-trust and secure dev pipelines.

DSS proposes public-facing equivalents for non-coders and end users.

Strong fit for industry consortia & software standards orgs.

6. Citizen-Grade Training & Certification
💬 Seldom discussed | 🔍 Undervalued | 🆕 DSS Normalizes It

Rarely considered in mainstream cyber — seen as IT-only domain.

DSS reframes this as civic hygiene (like CPR, fire drills, or MSHA).

Most innovative + most needed + most misunderstood.

📌 Recommendation:
Start with Credentialed Users and Software Credentials to build credibility, then transition to Zoning, Bot Prevention, and finally Citizen Training to reshape the culture.
