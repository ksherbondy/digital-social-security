Digital Social Security (DSS) Framework - A civic framework for collective digital security.

*******************************************************************************************************************************************************

***A Note from the Creator***
I’m not a cybersecurity professional. I’m not a developer by trade.
But I care deeply about the direction our digital society is heading — and this is my contribution.

This framework needs input from people far more experienced than I am. If you're one of those people, please help this grow. I’ve created this repo as an open blueprint — not a finished product. Let’s build DSS together.

Digital Social Security (DSS): A Civic Framework for a Safer Digital World
“From silos to society.”

Digital Social Security (DSS) is a collaborative, open framework for rethinking cybersecurity not as a technical problem, but as a shared civic responsibility — much like public health, neighborhood safety, or environmental stewardship.

DSS is not a product, a company, or a personal brand.
It is a call to action. A shared blueprint for a digital future where trust, safety, and accountability are fundamental rights — and responsibilities — of every participant in the system.

This repository exists to build that blueprint in the open.

🌐 What Is DSS?
DSS proposes a cultural and structural shift:

From isolated “cyber” teams → to distributed social security networks

From compliance-driven security → to values-driven responsibility

From reactive defense → to proactive digital stewardship

It draws inspiration from:

Farming models: Systems of care, growth, and sustainability

Military analogies: “Every Airman is a sensor” — every citizen a defender

Neighborhood Watch principles: Community-led, trust-based safety

Modern frameworks like DevSecOps and ESG, bridging technical and civic missions

🧩 What This Repo Contains
A living academic framework explaining DSS and its mission

Proposed credentialing systems, roles, and training tiers

Example policies, public charters, and a proposed “Bill of Digital Rights”

Drafts for a DSS Compliance Index modeled after ESG metrics

Concepts for web badges, open training, and digital certification layers

🤝 Who Owns This?
No one. And everyone.

This is a starting point — the first iteration of a shared civic framework. The original ideas were compiled and organized by a researcher and thinker with no formal authority in cybersecurity, only a deep conviction that the system is overdue for cultural redefinition.

If this resonates with you — run with it.
If it doesn’t — challenge it, evolve it, improve it.
