# Vision: Digital Social Security (DSS)

Digital Social Security is a civic-centered reimagining of cybersecurity — not just as a technical discipline, but as a shared public responsibility.

Our goal is to make cybersecurity:

- Understandable to the public  
- Actionable at every level (user, developer, company, institution)  
- Integrated like social infrastructure (roads, power, ID, education)  
- Measurable (like ESG or public health compliance)

We believe **security is not a product** — it’s a **relationship**.

> “Out of many, one. All for one. All together now.”
